## Takarushi's website

Welcome to the repository where i host my actual website, this one was made on Bootstrap 4 instead of Bulma which was the framework that my old site used (closed-source, no plans to release, sorry!), 

The site itself is really plain but it should work on most platforms 
>(i could ensure compatibility on Windows 7 and up using Internet Explorer 11Â®, Chrome, Edge Beta, Dev or Canary, OS X 10.10 and up, and most mobile devices using recents versions of their operating system).
 
 And in most networks
  >(Of course i can't totally be sure that this page works on your 2.5G connection, but it can on a 3G connection and better)

So, enjoy this shitty code and do whatever you want with it as long is inside of the terms of the MIT License :^).
